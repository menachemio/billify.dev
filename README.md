#### _Turn any database change into a billable event, without a programmer._

### Automated billing
We're a billing service that sits on top of your database and listens for changes.

A rules engine filters each database change, and if it meets the criteria of a billable event, it logs and calculates the charge according to your chosen formula.

The rule engine has GUI interface to allow non-programmers to use this product.

### Automated payments
The product will connect with your Payrix (or other second-rate payment processor) API keys to configure payments, and will integrate with your accounting software too.
